<h2>The Creator</h2>

<p>Hello!My name is Aboubakar Samake and I am the author of this website.
I am a computer science student at Champlain College in Saint-Lambert.
I am an Ivory Coast immigrant and have been living in Canada for the past 9 years with my family.</p>

<h2>The Reason behind this website</h2>
<p>The reason behind the creation of this website is my burning passion for the sport itself.
Since my childhood, I was in love with the game. I played until the sun went down, from morning to night in my home country.
We were so engrossed in the game that we could play anytime and anywhere until our parents deprived us of it.
For some people, the game only ends on the field, but for me, the game will never end until I become a professional footballer. At least that's what I wanted, but unfortunately, things do not always happen as we want. My dream was starting to fade for some personal reasons. Now I have new dreams and I hope that one day, even if I can not become a footballer, I dream of playing an important role in a football federation. Why not try the Canadian Football Federation, who knows, only time will tell. </p>
